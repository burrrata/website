Hey I'm burrrata. 

I create tools and systems that allow people to do what they want, when they want, with who they want, whenever they want. 

Concretely this looks like:
- positive sum incentive mechanisms (cryptoeconomics)
- fun, intuitive, and interactive media and education materials (documnetation and developer resources)
- safe, secure, and simple apps that are easy to use and understand (everything else)

I've started doing that with my [projects](https://www.burrrata.ch/projects). If these or anything similar sounds like something you'd like to create, [let me know](working-together.md)!
